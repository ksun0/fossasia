A repo for FOSSASIA GCI github collaboration task

Hello FOSSASIA! My name is Kevin Sun, a high school junior at Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts, USA. I frequently use GitHub to upload my project code. The version control and collboration features are amazing. To edit the readme with the addition of the two previous setences, I created a new branch, commited the changes to the branch, created a pull request, and merged it with the master branch.
