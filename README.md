A repo for FOSSASIA GCI github collaboration task

Hello FOSSASIA! My name is Kevin Sun, a high school junior at Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts, USA. I frequently use GitHub to upload my project code. They are mostly front-end projects with HTML/CSS/JS and AngularJS framework, with the exception of a few Rails projects as I am diving into teh backend stack. The version control and collboration features are amazing. To edit the readme with the addition of the two previous setences, I created a new branch, commited the changes to the branch, created a pull request, and merged it with the master branch. Also, I quickly reviewed basic Github commands from the tutorial linked in your task description, which let me fork a repo, clone it to my local machine, create remotes, and merge to the upstream.

Next, I forked 5 repositories from FOSSASIA, including the website rpo at gci16.fossasia.org, susi_server, loklak_search, open-event-orga-server, and whatcanidofor.fossasia.org. To wrap up Github usage, I starred 10 repos on FOSSASIA, including the website repo (amazing design!). In part B, I filled out the form to join the Github team. Finally, I completed the social media tasks in part C.
